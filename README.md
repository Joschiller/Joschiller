## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello,

I'm Joachim, a software engineer from Germany.

Through the World Skills Competition I experienced a deep dive into the world of WPF and then got into Android-Development whilst being competitor for Skill 08 (Mobile Applications Development). This has been the entry point for my current focus: Developing mobile applications using Flutter.

Next to my job I also enjoy fiddling around with smaller software projects that reach from utility scripts up to little everyday applications.

Languages:

- current focus: Dart, TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- other stuff: Kotlin, C#/Java, Python

Frameworks:

- most beloved: Flutter, React
- other stuff: Ionic/React, .NET/WPF
